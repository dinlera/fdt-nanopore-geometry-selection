Systematic method for nanopore geometry optimization using a fuzzy decision tree approach validated through finite element simulations.

# Nanopore Geometry Selection Using Fuzzy Decision Tree

This repository provides the simulation models and fuzzy decision tree (FDT) implementation for optimizing nanopore geometry in resistive pulse sensing applications.

The method was developed as part of the study:
**"A Decision Tree-Based Method for Selecting Optimal Nanopore Geometry in Resistive Pulse Sensing"**  
(Dürdane Yılmaz, Ali Dinler, 2025)

## Contents

- COMSOL Multiphysics model files for simulating particle translocation through conical, cigar-shaped, and hourglass-shaped nanopores.
- Python scripts implementing the fuzzy decision tree (FDT) model using the `scikit-fuzzy` library.
- Sample simulation outputs and fuzzy decision examples for validation.
- Instructions for running simulations and fuzzy model evaluation.

## Purpose

The repository enables reproducibility of the nanopore geometry selection method described in the MethodsX article. Researchers can adapt the models and code for custom nanopore design tasks involving size discrimination, charge sensitivity, and trajectory robustness analysis.
